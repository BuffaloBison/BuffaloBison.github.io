Song
    -Allen Ginsberg

    The weight of the world
           is love.
    Under the burden
           of solitude,
    under the burden
           of dissatisfaction

           the weight,
    the weight we carry
           is love.

    Who can deny?
           In dreams
    it touches
           the body,
    in thought
           constructs
    a miracle,
           in imagination
    anguishes
           till born
    in human—
    looks out of the heart
           burning with purity—
    for the burden of life
           is love,

    but we carry the weight
           wearily,
    and so must rest
    in the arms of love
           at last,
    must rest in the arms
           of love.

    No rest
           without love,
    no sleep
           without dreams
    of love—
           be mad or chill
    obsessed with angels
           or machines,
    the final wish
           is love
    —cannot be bitter,
           cannot deny,
    cannot withhold
           if denied:

    the weight is too heavy

           —must give
    for no return
           as thought
    is given
           in solitude
    in all the excellence
           of its excess.

    The warm bodies
           shine together
    in the darkness,
           the hand moves
    to the center
           of the flesh,
    the skin trembles
           in happiness
    and the soul comes
           joyful to the eye—

    yes, yes,
           that’s what
    I wanted,
           I always wanted,
    I always wanted,
           to return
    to the body
           where I was born.

Below is a reprint of a chatGPT session titled "SSL_TLS_diff":

    @gmail.com:
    are SSL and TLS transport protocols?

    @chatGPT:Yes, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are both cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a computer network. TLS is the successor to SSL and is widely used today to secure web traffic and other types of communication.




    @gmail.com:
    does the authentication server decrypt the password record and compare the clear text password to the password received from a user?

    @chatGPT:No, it's generally not recommended to store passwords in clear text, as this would make them vulnerable to theft in case of a security breach. Instead, passwords are usually stored as hash values, which are created by applying a one-way hash function to the   password. When a user logs in, the authentication server hashes the entered password and compares it to the stored hash value. If the   two hash values match, the password is considered to be correct and the user is granted access. This way, even if the password          database is stolen, the attacker will only obtain the hash values, which cannot be easily reversed to obtain the original passwords.




    @gmail.com:
    Does TLS create the hash on the client side before sending?

    @chatGPT:No, TLS does not create a hash of the password on the client side before sending it to the server. Instead, TLS is typically used to secure the transmission of login credentials from the client to the server, but it is the server's responsibility to securely store the passwords. In general, the server should store the passwords as salted hashes to prevent attackers from easily cracking the passwords in case of a breach. When a user logs in, the client sends the login credentials to the server, which then hashes the password and compares it to the stored hash value. If the two hash values match, the user is granted access.




    @gmail.com:
    You are implying the sent login credentials are not encrypted.

    Yes, you are correct. I apologize for the mistake. Login credentials, including passwords, are usually encrypted when transmitted over a network, such as the Internet, to prevent eavesdropping and tampering. This encryption is provided by TLS (Transport Layer Security) or its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). When a client establishes a secure connection to a server using TLS, the client and server negotiate a session key that is used to encrypt the data transmitted between them. The encrypted data includes the login credentials, ensuring that they are protected from interception or tampering during transmission.




    @gmail.com:
    is there such a process as double encryption?

    @chatGPT:Yes, "double encryption" or "multiple encryption" refers to the process of encrypting a message or data multiple times, typically using different encryption algorithms or keys. The idea behind double encryption is to add an additional layer of security to the data, making it more difficult for an attacker to decrypt the data even if they are able to obtain one of the encryption keys. However, multiple encryption may also add complexity to the encryption process and may not always improve security in practice, as the security of an encryption system depends on many factors, including the strength of the encryption algorithms used, the size of the keys, and the methods used to securely manage the keys.




    @gmail.com:
    In what ways did Blackberry create a secure system of communication?

    @chatGPT:Blackberry created a secure system of communication by implementing several security measures and technologies in their devices and server infrastructure. Some of these include:

    Encryption: Blackberry devices and servers use strong encryption algorithms, such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to encrypt data transmitted over the air and at rest.

    End-to-end encryption: Blackberry's messaging system provides end-to-end encryption, meaning that the messages are encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted on the recipient's device.

    Closed system architecture: Blackberry's infrastructure is designed as a closed system, with tight control over the devices and servers that are part of the network. This makes it difficult for attackers to penetrate the system and access sensitive data.

    Secure boot process: Blackberry devices have a secure boot process that ensures that only authorized software can run on the device. This helps to prevent malware and other malicious software from being installed on the device.

    Remote wipe: Blackberry devices have the ability to be remotely wiped, allowing administrators to erase all data on the device if it is lost or stolen.

    These and other security measures helped to make Blackberry's communication system highly secure and attractive to government agencies and businesses looking for a secure mobile communication solution.




    @gmail.com:
    can you name some comm systems equivalent to Blackberry in use today?

    @chatGPT:Yes, there are several communication systems available today that are similar to Blackberry in terms of security and features. Some of these include:

    MobileIron: A mobile device management solution that provides secure communication and collaboration for businesses.

    Good Dynamic Secure Mobility Platform: A secure platform for mobile communication and collaboration, formerly known as Blackberry Dynamics.

    AirWatch: A mobile device management solution that provides secure communication and collaboration for businesses.

    Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions: MDM solutions from vendors such as VMware, Citrix, and Microsoft offer similar security features to Blackberry, including encryption, device management, and remote wipe capabilities.

    Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) solutions: EMM solutions from vendors such as BlackBerry, AirWatch, and MobileIron offer a comprehensive suite of security and management features for mobile devices and secure communication.

    These are just a few examples of communication systems that provide similar security and features to Blackberry. The specific solution that is best for a given organization will depend on its specific requirements and needs.

    Senator XXXXXXXXX:How are you so sure that it was he?
    Dr. XXXX: The same way that I’m sure that I’m talking to you
    right now, just basic memory functions and also just the level of
    norepinephrine and epinephrine in the brain that sort of, as you
    know, encodes—that neurotransmitter encodes memories into the
    hippocampus, and so the trauma-related experience then is kind of
    locked there, whereas other details kind of drift.
    Senator XXXXXXXXXX. So what you are telling us is this could not
    be a case of mistaken identity?
    Dr. XXXX. Absolutely not. 

    Senator YYYYY. Well, then let us go back to the incident. What
