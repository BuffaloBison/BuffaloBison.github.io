  <p><em>Note from self<br />
  </em><strong>As</strong> many of you have, I misdirected my attention. It's not an ideological battle, it's a moral one. Much more objectionable is the ignorance, or moreso the negation of the traditional moral foundation in America. Think of Washington not as two parties vying for your vote, but a monolith of criminals stalking your acquiescence.
